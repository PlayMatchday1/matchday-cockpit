# MatchDay API - facts established by observation

This file records what we know about the MatchDay admin API **from watching it
behave**, not from reading its spec. It exists because the OpenAPI spec is a
secondary source with at least two known errors (see below), and because the
match-editing screens in this app are built directly on these facts. If you are
reading this cold six months from now to build the next screen, start here.

## Authority order

When the spec, the code, and the observed behaviour disagree, trust them in this
order:

1. **Observed behaviour** - what the running staging API actually does.
2. **Code** - the NestJS backend / this repo's client.
3. **Spec** - the OpenAPI document. Secondary. Known-wrong in at least two places.

Everything below was established at authority level 1 (observed on staging,
match 2470 and five others) unless noted.

## Environments and the write client

- All writes so far are **staging only**: `https://matchday-stage.herokuapp.com`.
  Production is `https://playmatchday.herokuapp.com`.
- Writes go through `src/lib/matchdayStageApi.ts` and nowhere else. That module
  is `import "server-only"`, host-guarded on the parsed URL host (not a flag),
  single-shot with no retry (the API has no Idempotency-Key), and re-mints its
  JWT before expiry. Reads from production stay in `src/lib/matchdayApi.ts`.

## PUT /admin/matches/{id} is a PARTIAL update

Despite being a `PUT`, this endpoint has **PATCH semantics**: it whitelist-
validates the fields you send and leaves every omitted field untouched. Send
only the fields that changed; that diff object *is* the request body.

- Do **not** read-modify-write and echo the whole object back. The backend runs
  a `forbidNonWhitelisted` ValidationPipe, so echoing read-only fields
  (id, updatedAt, relations, ...) returns **HTTP 400**, naming the offending
  read-only fields. That 400 is how we mapped the read-only vs writable sets.
- A multi-field partial write moves exactly the keys you sent, plus the
  server-derived ones (updatedAt, startDateUtc, endDateUtc, ...). Proven.

## Prices are in CENTS

`registrationPrice` and `additionalSpotPrice` are integer **cents**.
`12000` renders as `$120.00`. Proven by writing `13337` and watching the editor
render `$133.37`, stored verbatim. Never send dollars.

## The field sets

There are **32 writable fields** and **22 read-only fields** on a match.

**Read-only (22)** - reject on write (they trip the 400): the id, the audit
timestamps, the derived `*Utc` dates, relation objects, `_count`, star ratings,
and the other server-owned fields surfaced by the whitelist rejection.

**Writable (32)** = the **23 modeled** editable keys (see
`EDITABLE_KEYS` in `src/lib/matchEditModel.ts`) **+ 9 writable-but-unmodeled**
fields. The 9 unmodeled writable fields are:

    teams, teamHomeId, teamAwayId, teamHomeScore, teamAwayScore,
    startDate, endDate, maxPlayerCount, hasOrganizer

## The deny-list: 5 fields blocked in the write client (was 7 - see Phase 7)

`DENY_WRITE_FIELDS` in `matchdayStageApi.ts` refuses these **5** before any
network call (throws `DeniedFieldError`):

    teams, teamHomeId, teamAwayId, teamHomeScore, teamAwayScore

Why denied: these are the match **result** and the teams array. Teams are edited
through their own endpoint (`PUT /admin/teams/{id}`); scores are a result-entry
action, not a field in a general match edit. Blind writes here corrupt outcomes.

The deny-list lives in the **write client**, not in any one screen - so every
screen built on the client inherits it. A field is dangerous because of the
API, not because a given component happens to lack a control for it.

`maxPlayerCount` and `hasOrganizer` were never denied - plausible future
controls, just unmodeled. `maxPlayerCount` is now surfaced in the full editor
(Phase 7 Part E). `startDate` and `endDate` were denied through Phase 6 and
came **off** the list in Phase 7; see the next section.

## Phase 7 date decision - startDate/endDate writable, editor owns the pair

Phase 7 lifted `startDate` and `endDate` off the deny-list. This was a
deliberate design decision, recorded here, not a bug fix.

**Evidence (staging match 2470, single writes, restored):**

- PUT `{ startDate }` shifted +1h -> startDate moved; the server re-derived
  `startDateUtc` by exactly +1h with the field offset preserved (5h, CDT);
  `endDate`/`endDateUtc` did **not** move; nothing else moved. Duration silently
  went 24.00h -> 23.00h.
- PUT `{ startDate, endDate }` both +1h -> both moved, both `*Utc` followed +1h,
  **duration preserved** at 24.00h, nothing else moved.

**The problem this created:** a start-only write silently changes a match's
duration, and because nothing validates the pair server-side (staging match 2473
has `endDate` BEFORE `startDate` - a negative duration is a reachable state), a
start-only shift can push a match past its own end.

**The decision - option (a): a time edit sends startDate AND endDate together,**
**preserving the loaded duration.** Chosen over option (b) (send startDate alone,
block any edit that would reach endDate) because:

- A "change the start time" edit that silently shortens or lengthens the match
  is a worse surprise than writing one extra, structurally identical field.
- Option (b) cannot repair a match that is *already* inverted; option (a)'s pair
  write can.
- The pair write is proven (above) and moves nothing unexpected.

**The rules any date/time control must follow:**

- Compute the delta from the loaded `startDate`, apply the SAME delta to the
  loaded `endDate`, send both. Preserve the original duration.
- The value is the wall-clock string verbatim: `date + "T" + time +
  ":00.000Z"`. **Never** call `new Date()` on it, never convert, never
  round-trip through a Date object (that reads the Z as UTC - see the landmine
  above). String surgery only.
- Never write the `*Utc` fields; the server derives them.
- A match that **loads already inverted** (`endDate` <= `startDate`) is shown as
  a warning and its date/time edit is held back - it is not silently rewritten.

## Dates: startDate/endDate are LOCAL WALL-CLOCK wearing a Z

This is the biggest landmine in the whole API.

- `startDate` and `endDate` come back with a `Z` suffix but they are **local wall
  time**, not UTC. `2026-08-07T20:04:29.753Z` means 8:04 PM *local*, not 8:04 PM
  UTC.
- `startDateUtc` and `endDateUtc` are the **DST-aware server derivations** - the
  true instant, computed through the match's timezone. Observed offsets:
  `+5h` in August (Central Daylight Time) and `+6h` in December (Central
  Standard Time). Production runs Central **and** Eastern cities, so the offset
  differs by **city AND by season**. There is no single constant to add.

**The landmine:** calling `new Date(startDate)` parses that `Z` as UTC and lands
the time 5 or 6 hours off. To read the wall-clock label safely, use the
`getUTC*` accessors on the parsed date (they pull back the labelled wall-clock
components) - which is exactly what `src/app/api/schedule-master/route.ts` does.
To get the true instant, use the `*Utc` field, which is what `matchPnL` and the
payment-window matching in `src/lib/mdapiMatchesRead.ts` use.

**Which date is authoritative:** the business already treats **`startDate`
(local wall-clock)** as the authoritative scheduling field - the schedule grids,
manager-pay, and slate views all key off the synced `start_date` column, and the
sync copies the API's `startDate` verbatim. `start_date_utc` is stored alongside
and used only where a genuine instant is required. So a future date control must
send **`startDate`** (local wall time, labelled `Z`, the same shape the API
returns) and let the server recompute `startDateUtc`/`endDateUtc`. Never write
the `*Utc` fields directly - they are derived and read-only.

**endDate carries real data, not a default:** across the six staging matches
pulled, durations (startDate -> endDate) were 24.00h, 30.93h, 9.00h, 0.75h,
0.25h, and one **negative** -9.75h (endDate before startDate). They vary widely,
so endDate is genuine per-match data (messy on staging test matches), not a
fixed 24h default. It stays denied regardless.

## autoCanceledMinutes is MINUTES (spec says hours - spec is WRONG)

`autoCanceledMinutes` is measured in **minutes**. The OpenAPI spec labels the
unit "hours"; the spec is **wrong**. Confirmed by Ryan, who operates the product.
Any control for this field is a minutes input - do not multiply or divide by 60.
(This is the authority order in action: operator + observed behaviour over spec.)

## maxPlayerCount vs maxTeamSize - the capacity landmine

Spec descriptions (level 3, but consistent with observed use):

- `maxPlayerCount` - "Maximum amount of players per match". The **total** match
  capacity cap.
- `minPlayerCount` - "Minimum amount of players per match". Total floor.
- `maxTeamSize2Team` - per-team size cap for the 2-team format.
- `maxTeamSize4Team` - per-team size cap for the 4-team format.

`maxPlayerCount` is **real and total, not vestigial and not per-team.** It was a
constant `10` on every staging test match (throwaway data), but in production
(`mdapi_matches.max_player_count`) it carries genuine varying values (12, 16, 18,
20, 30, ...) and is consumed across the app: it drives the tournament-premium
threshold in manager pay (`>= 25` / `> 22`), the "X / Y signed up" capacity
display, and the Soccer Central special-event rule (null/0 = special event).

**The landmine:** `maxTeamSize2Team` / `maxTeamSize4Team` are modeled and
editable, but `maxPlayerCount` is unmodeled and not surfaced. The two are
independent. If someone raises the per-team sizes without also raising
`maxPlayerCount`, the **total** cap can silently limit signups below the intended
team configuration (e.g. a 2-team match with per-team size 10 wants 20 players,
but `maxPlayerCount = 10` caps it at 10). Any screen that edits team sizes must
either surface `maxPlayerCount` too or explicitly account for it.

## Running scripts against this client

Scripts that import the server-only write module run with:

    NODE_OPTIONS="--conditions=react-server" npx tsx scripts/<name>.ts

(`server-only` is installed as a devDep and resolves to a no-op under that
condition; without the flag it throws - which is the proof it can't reach a
client bundle.)
